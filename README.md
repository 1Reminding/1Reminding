Welcome to my Github page! 

I am Xing qinghua, a student majoring in Internet of Things Engineering at the School of Computer Science,Nankai University

Interest in **LLM-Agent**, **MAS** and **NLP** 

#### üå± Things I am currently working on üå± : 
- **ScImpactPredict**: Predicting the impact of academic papers based on LLMs,Please refer to the [ScImpactPredict](https://github.com/1Reminding/ScImpactPredict) for more details.
- **MediChain-LLM-Agent**: Developing a specialized agent in the medical domain using the Langchain framework, with a frontend built in JavaScript. This agent provides precise medication recommendations based on patient symptoms and a custom-built drug database, offering more accurate and coherent results compared to general-purpose LLMs. Please refer to the [MediChain-LLM-Advisor](https://github.com/1Reminding/MediChain-LLM-Advisor) for more details.
- **Multimodal Fake News Detection**: Detecting high-risk content with a focus on text-image dual modality, and summarizing risk points. The image modality employs a heatmap attention mechanism to detect high-risk points, while the text modality uses sequential masking to observe changes in loss, identifying potential high-risk content. This system integrates a large model to enhance detection capabilities, leveraging the model for cross-modal information fusion and for assisting in identifying potential patterns and inconsistencies in fake news generation.
- **Multimodal Dialect Translation Platform**: Translating dialects from low-resource corpora, incorporating tone extraction, and integrating digital avatars for more vivid and accurate interactions.
- Frontend Design and Development: Engaged in designing and developing user interfaces with a focus on enhancing user experience. 
- [My website](https://1Reminding.github.io) üöÄ *coming soon*

#### ‚ö° Things recent ones I'm interested in ‚ö° :
